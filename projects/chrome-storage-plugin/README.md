# NgxsChromeStoragePlugin

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

This library enables the use of [Chrome storage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage) for chrome extensions with Ngxs.

The code is largely copied from the official [Ngxs storage plugin](https://github.com/ngxs/store/tree/master/packages/storage-plugin). The only changes come from using the asynchronous storage API present in chrome.
