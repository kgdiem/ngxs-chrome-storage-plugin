# NgxsChromeStoragePlugin

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

This library enables the use of [Chrome storage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage) for chrome extensions with Ngxs.

The code is largely copied from the official [Ngxs storage plugin](https://github.com/ngxs/store/tree/master/packages/storage-plugin). The only changes come from using the asynchronous storage API present in chrome.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project chrome-storage-plugin` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project chrome-storage-plugin`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project chrome-storage-plugin` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build chrome-storage-plugin` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build chrome-storage-plugin`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/chrome-storage-plugin` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test chrome-storage-plugin` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
