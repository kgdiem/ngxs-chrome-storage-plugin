# NgxsChromeStoragePlugin

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.4.

This library enables the use of [Chrome storage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage) for chrome extensions with Ngxs.

The code is largely copied from the official [Ngxs storage plugin](https://github.com/ngxs/store/tree/master/packages/storage-plugin). The only changes come from using the asynchronous storage API present in chrome.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
